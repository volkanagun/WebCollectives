# WebCollectives

Web collectives is a web content extraction and crawler libray focused on simplicity and ease of use. 
The crawler is integrated into the content extraction process. The user specify the rules to extract the links and later the rule templates are used to
extract structured XML document from the HTML content without using DOM. Each domain has its own set of rules thouhg these rules can be extracted
through statistical inference without any supervision. In terms of simlicity, the tool uses file system for storing the contents, and 
it can not be compared with large scale models such as Nutch, Lucene or Solr. The WebCollectives library can be integrated as a data gathering process for these tools.
